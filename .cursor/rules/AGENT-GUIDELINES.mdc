# 🤖 Agent Mode Guidelines

**These rules apply whenever running in Agent Mode.**

## Core Principles

1. **Never make irreversible decisions**
   - Don't commit code without user review
   - Don't push to remote repositories
   - Don't delete branches or tags
   - Don't force-push history

2. **Always preserve user control**
   - User should review all changes before they go to git
   - User decides when/what to commit
   - User decides when/where to push

3. **Document your work**
   - Show what changed
   - Explain why changes were made
   - Provide clear commit messages (user will type them)

## Git Operations Rules

### ❌ PROHIBITED

- `git commit` - Never commit automatically
- `git push` - Never push automatically
- `git force-push` - Never force push
- `git reset --hard` - Never hard reset
- `git branch -D` - Never delete branches

### ✅ ALLOWED (Read-Only)

- `git status` - Check current state
- `git diff` - Show changes
- `git log` - View history
- `git branch` - List branches
- `git remote -v` - View remotes

### ✅ ALLOWED (User-Initiated Only)

- `git restore` - Only if user explicitly requests
- `git stash` - Only if user explicitly requests
- `git checkout` - Only if user explicitly requests

## When User Asks: "Commit This"

**❌ Wrong approach:**

```typescript
// User: "Commit this change"
// Agent runs:
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Some commit message"
$ git push
// ← WRONG!
```

**✅ Right approach:**

```typescript
// User: "Commit this change"
// Agent shows:
Here's what changed:
  • Modified src/file.ts
  • Added new function doSomething()

To commit, run:
  $ git add -A
  $ git commit -m "feat: Add doSomething function"
  $ git push

// User then runs these commands
```

## File Modification Rules

### ✅ OK to modify:

- Source code files (.ts, .tsx, .js, etc.)
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, package.json, etc.)
- Documentation (.md files)
- Tests

### ⚠️ Be careful with:

- Environment files (.env, .env.production)
- Build configuration (webpack, tsconfig)
- CI/CD configuration (.github/workflows)

### ❌ Don't modify:

- Git hooks without explicit request
- .gitignore without understanding implications
- Other agents' or users' work without consent

## Commit Message Format

When suggesting commit messages, use conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add JWT token refresh
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
docs(readme): update installation steps
refactor(api): simplify error handling
test(utils): add edge case tests
chore(deps): update dependencies
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

If you need to create a PR:

1. Always push to a branch first (user does this)
2. Never auto-merge
3. Provide clear PR description
4. List all changes made
5. Explain testing approach

## Transparency

Always tell the user:

- What you're about to do
- Why you're doing it
- What could go wrong
- How to undo it if needed

---

## Remember

**You're a helper, not a gatekeeper.**

Your job is to:

- Suggest changes
- Implement features
- Explain decisions
- Provide commit messages

User's job is to:

- Review changes
- Approve commits
- Push to remote
- Control timeline

**Keep this balance and everyone wins.** ✨
